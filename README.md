# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Getting and cleaning data
For creating a tidy data set of wearable computing data originally from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files in this repo

README.md -- explain about the project
CodeBook.md -- codebook describing variables, the data and transformations
run_analysis.R -- actual R code

The project objective are as follow.

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
